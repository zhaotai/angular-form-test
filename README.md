# `angular-form-test` â€” a form prototype built by angular

This project is just a prototype for an interview.


## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the `angular-form-test` repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the `angular-form-test` repository. You can get git from [here][git].

We also use a number of Node.js tools to initialize and test `angular-form-test`. You must have Node.js
and its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from [here][node].

### Clone `angular-form-test`

Clone the `angular-form-test` repository using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/angular/angular-form-test.git
cd angular-form-test
```

If you just want to start a new project without the `angular-form-test` commit history then you can do:

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/angular/angular-form-test.git <your-project-name>
```

The `depth=1` tells git to only pull down one commit worth of historical data.

### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and Angular framework code. The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [Node package manager][npm].
* We get the Angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].
* In order to run the end-to-end tests, you will also need to have the
  [Java Development Kit (JDK)][jdk] installed on your machine. Check out the section on
  [end-to-end testing](#e2e-testing) for more info.

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`. After that, you should find out that you have
two new folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need

*Note that the `bower_components` folder would normally be installed in the root folder but
`angular-form-test` changes this location through the `.bowerrc` file. Putting it in the `app` folder
makes it easier to serve the files by a web server.*

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:8000/index.html`][local-app-url].


## Directory Layout

```
app/                    --> all of the source files for the application
  app.css               --> default stylesheet
  components/           --> all app specific modules
    my-typeahead/              --> directive related components
      typeahead-directive.html     --> directive template
      typeahead-directive.js       --> custom directive
  data/                 --> data directory
    users.json          --> simulate the REST api
  form/                --> the form view template and logic
    form.html            --> the partial template
    form.css             --> the template css
    form.js              --> the controller logic
    form_test.js         --> tests of the controller
  libs/                 --> all the dependencies
    **/*.js
  app.js                --> main application module
  index.html            --> app layout file (the main html template file of the app)
karma.conf.js         --> config file for running unit tests with Karma
e2e-tests/            --> end-to-end tests
  protractor-conf.js    --> Protractor config file
  scenarios.js          --> end-to-end scenarios to be run by Protractor
```


## Testing

There are two kinds of tests in the `angular-form-test` application: Unit tests and end-to-end tests.

### Running Unit Tests

The `angular-form-test` app comes preconfigured with unit tests. These are written in [Jasmine][jasmine],
which we run with the [Karma][karma] test runner. We provide a Karma configuration file to run them.

* The configuration is found at `karma.conf.js`.
* The unit tests are found next to the code they are testing and have an `_test.js` suffix (e.g.
  `form_test.js`).

The easiest way to run the unit tests is to use the supplied npm script:

```
npm test
```

This script will start the Karma test runner to execute the unit tests. Moreover, Karma will start
watching the source and test files for changes and then re-run the tests whenever any of them
changes.
This is the recommended strategy; if your unit tests are being run every time you save a file then
you receive instant feedback on any changes that break the expected code functionality.

You can also ask Karma to do a single run of the tests and then exit. This is useful if you want to
check that a particular version of the code is operating as expected. The project contains a
predefined script to do this:

```
npm run test-single-run
```

### Running End-to-End Tests

The `angular-form-test` app comes with end-to-end tests, again written in [Jasmine][jasmine]. These tests
are run with the [Protractor][protractor] End-to-End test runner. It uses native events and has
special features for Angular applications.

* The configuration is found at `e2e-tests/protractor-conf.js`.
* The end-to-end tests are found in `e2e-tests/scenarios.js`.

Protractor simulates interaction with our web app and verifies that the application responds
correctly. Therefore, our web server needs to be serving up the application, so that Protractor can
interact with it.
